# Mobile Device Keyboard Programming Challenge

> This programming challenge will implement an algorithm which attempts to guess what the user is trying to type

## Installation

- Just clone it and run the Main class

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/achillesfist/Autocomplete.git`

## Features

- I attempted to make it so that it would give you suggestions as you typed, but apparently that is near impossible to do
in Java with only the console. I would have had to create a GUI with Swing or something to accomplish what I imagined.
Therefore sadly you have to hit enter between submissions and it won't be able to give you suggestions while you type.

## Usage

- To train a passage, type an entire sentence ending with a period, question mark or exclamation point.

- To get autocomplete suggestions, type a fragment (with no punctuation).

- To quit, type a single period.

## Note

- I ignored some of the visibility stuff since it seemed out of the scope of the question and would add some extra
code. For example, the instance variables in Node are all public when they should be private.
