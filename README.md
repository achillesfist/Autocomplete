# Mobile Device Keyboard Programming Challenge

> This programming challenge will implement an algorithm which attempts to guess what the user is trying to type

## Installation

- Just clone it and run the Main class

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/achillesfist/Autocomplete.git`

## Features

- I attempted to make it so that it would give you suggestions as you typed, but apparently that is near impossible to do
in Java with only the console. I would have had to create a GUI with Swing or something to accomplish what I imagined.
Therefore sadly you can only train entire sentences at a time.

## Usage

- To train a passage, type an entire sentence ending with a period, question mark or exclamation point.
To get autocomplete suggestions, type a fragment (with no punctuation).
To quit, type a single period.
