# Mobile Device Keyboard Programming Challenge

> This programming challenge will implement an algorithm which attempts to guess what the user is trying to type

- Most people will glance at your `README`, *maybe* star it, and leave
- Ergo, people should understand instantly what your project is about based on your repo


## Installation

- Just clone it and run the Main class

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/achillesfist/Autocomplete.git`

## Features

- I attempted to make it so that it would give you suggestions as you typed, but apparently that is near impossible to do
in Java with only the console. Therefore sadly you can only train entire sentences at a time.

## Usage

To train a passage, type an entire sentence ending with a period, question mark or exclamation point.
To get autocomplete suggestions, type a fragment (with no punctuation).
To quit, type a single period.
